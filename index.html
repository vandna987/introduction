<td>1</td>
<td><u><b>Descrete Mathematics</u></b><br>Previous Knowledge:Our Syllabus covers the major part of Discrete Mathematics, which includes Mathematical Logic, Boolean Algebra, Set Theory, Relations, Functions, Group Theory etc.
<br> Discrete means unconnected so through all this topics we are going to learn to our programmming languages are indirectly connected with Mathematical Logic.
<br> This logic is used to determine the link between computer in a network and to determine a valid internet address.

Expectation:This subject is taught by "Dr. Madhvi Shakya Mam".<br>
The topics which was included in this subject is already covered in our graduation level, but here we are studying it in deep, for knowledge purpose.</td></tr></a>
<tr>
<td>2</td><td><b><u>Data Structure</b></u><br>Previous Knowledge:In Data Structure we are are learning the basis, how we can store data in our memory through various data storing methods likes through Arrays,
<br> Linked List, Stack, Queue, Trees and Graphs. Initially I am aware about arrays ,linked list , stack, queue and trees but on a basic level.
<br> Here we are learning much more about this concept. The most interesting topic I found was linked list and stack, queue.

Expectation:This subject was taught by "Prof. Amit Bhagat". <br>

<br> I have learn almost every topic of C language during my graduation, here I am learning so many new concepts ,this helps me to improve my existing skills in C language. 
<br>Through theory wise it seems to be little but it is very vast topic ,because this language is the base of all the other coding languages.

Expectation: This subject is taught by "Prof. Anirban Chowdhury".<br>
 The topics which was included in this subject is already covered in our graduation level, here our teacher taught the topics by explaining various variation in a particular thing, so that helpful to clear our concepts more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td><b><u>Computer Architecture</u></b><br>Previous Knowledge:This subject covers major part of organization and Architecture of computer which includes Memory Management,Microprocessor, Logic Circuits,Registers etc.
<br> Here we are learning diffrent types of storing tools which are required to store the data and their functionality.And also we are learning about different types of microprocessor and their working procedure.

Expectation:This subject is taught by "Prof. Anoop K. Tiwari". 
<br>The topics which was included in this subject is already covered in our graduation level, but here I am expecting some deep knowledge about it.</tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td><b><u>Business Communication</u></b><br>Previous Knowledge:This subject is really interesting, here we are learning the how to communicate effectively.

<br>I found it a interesting class through here, I get chance to learn soo much about designing a web page.

Expectation:This subject is taught by "Prof. Anirban Chowdhury". 
<br>The topics which was included in this subject is already covered in our graduation level, but here I am expecting to learn more about it, by practising and applying different variations in it.
<br> This is really going interesting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td><b><u>C-Programming Lab</u></b><br>Previous Knowledge:We are also having a theory clases of this subject, so to implement it pratically become more efficent for us.
<br>Here we are polishing our existing skills of C language, by coding practise. Every week we are assigned to do a new task, which helps us to make our concepts more strong.

Expectation:This subject is taught by "Prof. Anoop K. 
<br>Tiwari". The topics which was included in this subject is already covered in our graduation level, but practical knowledge is very necessary in this subject so, here we are developing our concepts.</td></tr>
